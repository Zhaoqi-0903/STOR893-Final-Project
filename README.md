## Structural and Functional Brain Networks: From Connectome to Major Depression

**Connectome** refers to the concept of the human brain as a large-scale complex network. In other words, the human connectome captures the functional and structural connections of brain regions in terms of brain networks. **Major depression** is a psychiatric disorder, which is characterized by persistent low-mood and often accompanied by several heterogeneous symptoms for different individuals. In this project, we are interested gaining the sharper insight into **the relationship between brain connectivity and major depression**. Firstly, we want to check whether the major depressive disorder will make changes in the brain networks. We use both the connectivity matrices and dimension-reduction PCA scores to perform tests and do visualization. Secondly, we try to fit models to predict the major depression using the brain connectome data.
